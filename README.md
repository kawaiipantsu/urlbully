> In THUGSred (red-team) we use all sorts of tools and scripts, many home-grown just as this one. There might not be anything revolutionary about it, typically it simply solves a need we have at a givin task/problem. In this case, i often find myself quickly wanting to create some "spam" options for grabbing URL's via HTTP machanics but it always ends up with me creating new small scripts for each task - This tool solves that ʘ‿ʘ
